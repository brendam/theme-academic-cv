# Abstract.
abstract: "Sharing platforms for creative content are often closely connected to general purpose social media platforms like Twitter. This also means that coordinated and automated mechanisms for promoting such content are likely to span both sites: spammers and bots operate across both platforms. This work-in-progress paper presents first results from an effort to develop activity metrics that enable the detection of Twitter bots promoting SoundCloud content."
