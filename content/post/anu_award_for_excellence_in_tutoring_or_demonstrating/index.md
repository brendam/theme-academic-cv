On June 18th I was awarded the **2012 ANU Award for Excellence in Tutoring or Demonstrating**.

The award was presented by DVC (Academic) Professor Marnie Hughes-Warrington at a celebration during ResearchFest. I was one of three joint winners to receive the award, from a pool of 38 nominees and hundreds of ANU tutors and demonstrators.

Description of the award from the ANU ResearchFest website:

>Much of the small group teaching done at ANU is by HDR students as tutors and demonstrators. Many tutors and demonstrators are the 'face' of the university for their students, and hence their role as teachers is vitally important. The Award for Excellence in Tutoring or Demonstrating recognises outstanding contributions to teaching and learning at ANU.

I am tutor and sessional lecturer for [SCOM1001 Science and Public Awareness](http://studyat.anu.edu.au/courses/SCOM1001;details.html) and [SCOM8012 Science Communication and the Web](http://studyat.anu.edu.au/courses/SCOM8012;details.html).
